## Project Experience


### Recommender Systems Design & ML Algorithms Implementation (_Sep. 2021 - Nov. 2021_)
[Code Here](https://github.com/putan1122/portfolio/tree/main/Projects_public/recommendation_system)
- Investigated and evaluated machine learning algorithms on Amazon recommendation datasets; designed and developed quantitative analysis system to extract samples from datasets with 255,404 users and items
- Implemented three classical Machine Learning algorithms, e.g., BPRMF, ItemKNN; optimized the classical methods with two state-of-the-art deep learning methods, such as DeepFM and LightGCN with 17% improvement in recall and 11% in Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)
- Performed hyper-parameter tuning with 10-fold cross-validation, achieving 75% recall and 56% NDCG



### Sentiment Analysis for Marketing via NLP (_Sep. 2022 - Nov. 2022_) 
[Code Here](https://github.com/putan1122/portfolio/tree/main/DS_projects/sentiment_classification)
- Applied NLPK to process and classify the language text and performed exploratory data analysis on IMDB social media comments and Amazon review with Pandas in Python, ELT processing with SQL queries in Spark
- Analyzed the reviews with a state-of-the-art deep learning technique, BERT and DistilBERT; evaluated DistilBERT on predicting the positive sentiment assessment and achieved 66% recall, 60% precision

### Predicting Medical Conditions with InVitro Cell Research (Kaggle Ranked Top 4%) ** (_May 2023 - Aug. 2023_)
[Code Here](https://github.com/putan1122/portfolio/tree/main/Projects_public/pred_medical_condition)
  - Identified age-related features in anonymized data, improving balanced log-loss scores
  - Applied robust feature engineering techniques to ensure model stability and scalability on limited datasets [See the competition here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/icr-identify-age-related-conditions)

### COVID-19 Vaccines Distribution Policy Design with Reinforcement Learning (_Jun. 2021 - Sep. 2021_)
- Researched and developed linear regression, random forest, and AdaBoost models to estimate confirmed COVID-19 cases in San Diego; implemented deep Q-network (DQN) model with the estimated number of cases to distribute three types of vaccines, decreasing confirmed cases by 1.9%
- Designed a prediction + optimization framework consisting of random forest and DQN to derive the optimal distribution strategy
- Summarized the proposed method as a first-author research paper which was published in 2021 4th International Conference on Big Data and Machine Learning (Paper ID: BP2103) [Read the paper here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ig61UdLxVR-UuEGop_c0rCfp4_tZ4W5c/view?usp=sharing)
