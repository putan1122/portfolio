# Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Using LSTM and Multiple Features
## Predicting Google Stock Prices

### Overview
This case study demonstrates how to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units to build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict Google stock prices. The model takes into account multiple predictive factors, such as historical lows, highs, trading volume, and adjusted price.

### Technologies Used
- Tensorflow 1.15.0
- Keras 2.3.1

### Data Source
